# Mobile_Automation_Project
This project demonstrates mobile test automation using Java, leveraging Selenium and Appium for interacting with mobile applications, and Android Studio for building and managing emulators.
# Technologies Used
- Selenium: Used for web automation, and its WebDriver concept extends to mobile automation via Appium.
- Appium: An open-source tool for automating native, mobile web, and hybrid applications on iOS mobile, Android mobile, and Windows desktop platforms. It drives iOS and Android apps using the WebDriver protocol.
- Android Studio: Essential for setting up and managing Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) or emulators, which are used as target devices for mobile automation.
- Java: The primary programming language used for writing test scripts.
